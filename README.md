## Home assistant on an epaper screen. ##

The project uses a [7.5 inch Waveshare e-paper display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT_(B)_Manual#Resources),
and converts images into black and white, with some transformations applied before the display.

The images are screenshots taken from home assistant (regularly), although other sources could also be used. Images are
switched by triggering a motion detector with a swipe of the hand.

I use a Raspberry Pi Zero W to drive the e-paper.
